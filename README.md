## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to test how specific users will interact with the features and flow of the app as expected. The most important part is to gain feedback on whether or not the flow of each task is intuitive and clear and thus gain feedback on which improvements should be made. In addition, this prototype will draw on my user research which revealed the lack of knowledge on daily journals and the potential benefits of it. My user research also helped clarify what exactly users want to record and prioritize when it comes to creating daily journals. 
### Personas
The first persona is a 44 year old working mom named Elizabeth Montgomery. She focuses on spending time with her children and keeping them mentally and physically active despite her busy schedule. She prioritizes simple technology that also is fun to use and has clear benefits for both her and her children. The second persona is 21 year old UCLA student Marcus Wang. His focus is boosting productivity and having detailed records of each of his days. His goals are to improve his schoolwork and productivity through proper mental care.
### Features
The three features being tested today are: 
1. Creating a basic daily journal 
2. Creating a new habit to be tracked
3. Viewing records of past journals

Notes from user testing: The main issue the user ran into here was the drop menu taking users to a whole different page rather than adding an overlay that is usually expected of a drop menu. Choosing mood was also an unexpected interaction since there were not as many options as desired. There was also a question of what would happen after the final Done! screen and whether or not there was a way to return to the home screen. 
## Feature 2

Notes from user testing: The main issue the user ran into here was the open-endedness of each prompt. For example, the ability to create any new habit was confusing, or the strict options of only daily, weekly, or monthly. 
## Feature 3

Notes from user testing: The only issue the user ran into in this feature was that since this page looked like the daily journal page, many of the buttons of the page look clickable. In reality, nothing on the page is clickable or causes any action except for the Done button. 
## Reflection
The process of creating a low fidelity prototype was interesting and a learning experience. The restrictions of creating a low fidelity prototype helped point out more glaring fundamental errors that might pass through a high fidelity prototype due to the extra distractions. Overall, it went smoothly since this app is very simplistic by nature, with a minimal amount of screens and interactions necessary. For that same reason, any feedback is key to making sure that the simplicity does not hinder the functionality of the app. The first issue was the drop down menu taking users to a different page rather than adding a drop down overlay. This is a simple and straightforward fix of just adding the drop down bar interaction. The second issue is that selecting a mood is much more difficult than anticipated. Since moods are very abstract, selecting from a list of moods may be confusing and non-representative. A change for this could be increasing the amount of moods available and allowing up to 3 moods to be chosen. Another issue was the open-endedness of prompts in creating habits. A fix for this could be having set times to choose from and also a customizable reminder for each habit. The last issue was the confusing layout of the records of past journals. Users had previously seen an identical page but were able to interact with it and change it. Therefore, a fix would be to change the actual visual design of the screen to make it clear that there are no affordances/buttons.
